<h1>The Best Movies Accroding to Michel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-times</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Spider Man(Sam Ramy's Trilogy)</h3>
<p>
  This was the first movie I have ever seen on the big screem of a movie
  theater. In my opinion, this is one of the best super hero movies ever made,
  even the CGI looks way better when compared to many of the latest upcoming
  blockbusters.
</p>
<h3>Catch me if you can</h3>
<p>
  As big fan of DiCaprio movies, this master piece could never be left out of
  this list. One of the most exiting plots I have ever seen.
</p>
<h3>Guardians of the galaxy vol.2</h3>
<p>
  For sure one of the best MCU movies ever made, perfectly balanced. No further
  comments.
